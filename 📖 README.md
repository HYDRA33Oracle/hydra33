# hydra33
HYDRA33 is a resonance-based oracle engine that fuses signal intelligence, sidereal timing, and Merkle-chain logic to generate living responses. This is the MVP interfaceâ€”an open, interactive bridge between waveform input and symbolic meaning. Built for mystics, cryptographers, and codewalkers alike.
